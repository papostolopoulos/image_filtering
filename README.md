# Image filtering through algorithm manipulation
## Q3 Galvanize project (Rob, Tommy, Paris)
The objective of this project is to create an online tool of image filtering through the use of algorithms

### Program features
The program needs to allow the user the following actions:
- Open images from his hard drive
- Open images from a URL
- Be able to select between two options. Editing or applying "art" on an image:
- save his modified image in his hard drive
- Be able to select on the parameters of the filtering

The features that the program needs to offer are:
- Create a negative of the imported image
- Edge detection
- Create art through algorithm implementation

Nice to have features:
- Zooming of the image
- drag bars that allow the different feature changes

### Things to work on
- Research on how to use the `<canvas>` tag in order to manipulate images wrapped around it
